# XGBoost Classification Analysis of Comorbidities for Predicting Mortality from COVID
  The recent Covid-19 pandemic created an unprecedented strain on hospitals and healthcare organizations. The need for beds 
outnumbered the available beds (French et al., 2021). The inpatient staff was stretched thin while the outpatient staff 
was furloughed due to clinic closures (Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, 2022). Shortages 
of supplies and medications for patients and protective equipment for staff were caused by both increased use and supply
chain issues (Hick, 2021). The fiscal impact was devastating as well. Hospitals faced a paradox of increased business 
with less revenue. Reimbursement was down due to an increase in uninsured and Medicaid patients laid off from their jobs.
Elective surgeries and procedures that are a major revenue source were halted during surges (Balser, 2021).
  Healthcare organizations need a predictive tool to inform ways to minimize the impact of Covid on operations. 
The hypothesis of this study is that the comorbidities of patients diagnosed with Covid-19 can be used to predict the
risk of mortality with statistical significance.
